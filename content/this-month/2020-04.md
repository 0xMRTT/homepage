Welcome to the first issue of _"This Month in Rust OSDev"_. In these posts, we will try to give an regular overview of notable changes in the Rust operating system development community.

<!-- more -->

These posts are the successor of the [_"Status Update"_ posts](https://os.phil-opp.com/status-update/) on the _"Writing an OS in Rust"_ blog. Instead of only focusing on the updates to the blog and the directly related crates, we try to give an overview of the full Rust OSDev ecosystem in this new series. This includes all the projects under the [`rust-osdev`] GitHub organization, relevant projects of other organizations, and also personal OS projects.

This series is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/). Feel free to open pull requests there with content you would like to see in the next issue. If you find some issues on this page, please report them by [creating an issue](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/issues/new).

## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

### `x86_64`

The [`x86_64` crate](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64) provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

This month, we released version `0.10.0` of `x86_64`, which includes some breaking changes:

- _Breaking:_ [Make `map_to` and `update_flags` unsafe](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/135)
- _Breaking:_ [Make FrameDeallocator::deallocate_frame unsafe](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/146)
- _Breaking:_ [Don't pass small trivially copyable types by reference](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/147)
- [Use `#[inline]` everywhere](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/145)
- [Add `{PhysFrame,Page}::from_start_address_unchecked`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/142)

After `v0.10.0`, the following changes were merged:

- [Add `InterruptDescriptorTable::load_unsafe`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/137) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.10.1`)</span>
- [Use `llvm_asm!` instead of deprecated `asm!` macro](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/151)
    - This might break older nightlies. Given that version `0.10.x` is so recent, we still decided to release only a patch version. Note that this isn't a breaking change in the `semver` sense since we only guarantee compatibility with recent nightlies.
- [Return the correct RPL from `GDT::add_entry()`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/153) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.10.2`)</span>

Thanks to [@m-ou-se](https://github.com/m-ou-se), [@tomaka](https://github.com/tomaka), [@haraldh](https://github.com/haraldh), and [@imtsuki](https://github.com/imtsuki) for their contributions!

### `bootloader`

The [`bootloader` crate](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader) implements a custom Rust-based bootloader for easy loading of 64-bit ELF executables. It received the following updates last month:

- [SSE feature: remove inline assembly + don't set reserved bits](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/105) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.9.1`)</span>
- [Use `llvm_asm!` instead of deprecated `asm!`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/108) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.9.2`)</span>

Thanks to [@Freax13](https://github.com/Freax13) and [@realKennyStrawn93](https://github.com/realKennyStrawn93) for these changes!

Additionally, [@rybot666](https://github.com/rybot666) and [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp) are currently working on a rewrite of the bootloader. The goal is to port the 16-bit and 32-bit stages from assembly to Rust, which should make the crate safer, more composable, and easier to understand for outsiders. Our progress is tracked in the [`Rewrite` milestone](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/milestone/1).
