Welcome to the first issue of _"This Month in Rust OSDev"_. In these posts, we will try to give an regular overview of notable changes in the Rust operating system development community.

<!-- more -->

These posts are the successor of the [_"Status Update"_ posts](https://os.phil-opp.com/status-update/) on the _"Writing an OS in Rust"_ blog. Instead of only focusing on the updates to the blog and the directly related crates, we try to give an overview of the full Rust OSDev ecosystem in this new series. This includes all the projects under the [`rust-osdev`] GitHub organization, relevant projects of other organizations, and also personal OS projects.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about
