Welcome to the first issue of _"This Month in Rust OSDev"_. In these posts, we will try to give an regular overview of notable changes in the Rust operating system development community.

<!-- more -->

These posts are the successor of the [_"Status Update"_ posts](https://os.phil-opp.com/status-update/) on the _"Writing an OS in Rust"_ blog. Instead of only focusing on the updates to the blog and the directly related crates, we try to give an overview of the full Rust OSDev ecosystem in this new series. This includes all the projects under the [`rust-osdev`] GitHub organization, relevant projects of other organizations, and also personal OS projects.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

This series is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/). Feel free to open pull requests there with content you would like to see in the next issue. If you find some issues on this page, please report them by [creating an issue](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/issues/new).

## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

### `x86_64`

### `bootloader`

### `bootimage`

### `cargo-xbuild`

### `acpi`
The `acpi` repository contains crates for parsing the [ACPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface) tables - data structures that the firmware of modern computers use to relay information about the hardware to the OS. The crate for parsing the static tables ([`acpi`](https://crates.io/crates/acpi)) was stabilised this month - while it needs more work to support the entire spec, it is now in the state where it can be integrated into a Rust kernel to provide useful information, and its overall architecture is unlikely to change in the near future.

## Personal Projects

### `phil-opp/blog_os`

### [`IsaacWoods/pebble`](https://github.com/IsaacWoods/pebble)
Pebble has been undergoing a bit of a reorganisation, in the interests of supporting a second architecture (ARM64). A hardware abstraction layer (HAL) has been introduced that abstracts away the platform-specifics of managing page tables, creating processes etc. so that the main `kernel` crate is now completely platform-independent.

I also wrote a [little TFTP server](https://github.com/IsaacWoods/pebble/blob/master/tools/tftp_serve/src/main.rs) for netbooting a Raspberry Pi 4 from a development machine. This makes iterating the kernel a lot easier because there's no need to write it to an SD card after every compile. In the next few weeks, I hope to clean this code up and publish it for use as both a library and CLI application, and maybe write a blog-post on the intricacies of netbooting the Pi.
