## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In May, â€¦

### [`uefi-rs`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs)

The `uefi` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS. In May, we merged the following changes:

- [Switch to the newer `Try` trait API](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/221)
- [Add `FromResidual<Result<!, Error>>` impl for `Status`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/223)
- [Add `PartitionInfo` protocol](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/225)
- [Add shim lock protocol](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/226)

Thanks to [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp) and [@nicholasbishop](https://github.com/nicholasbishop) for their contributions!

### [`xhci`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci)

The `xhci` crate provides types of xHCI structures such as Contexts, Extended Capabilities, Registers, and TRBs.

In May we finished implementing all of these structures and field getters/setters. Still there may exist missings. If you find one, feel free to send a PR!
