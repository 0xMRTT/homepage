## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In December, â€¦

### [`rusty-hermit`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-hermit)

RustyHermit is a unikernel targeting a scalable and predictable runtime for high-performance and cloud computing.
This month, we integrate a [virtual i/o device driver](https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/csprd01/virtio-v1.1-csprd01.html), which based on memory mapped i/o and doesn't depend on  PCI device specification.
For instance, micro VMs like [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io) and Qemu's [microvm machine type](https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/i386/microvm.html) doesn't support the PCI specification to accelerate the boot time and to improve the performance.
With this device driver, `rusty-hermit` is able to run on Qemu's microvm platform.
We are working to support Firecracker in the near future.

If you maintain a Rust project related to operating system development and are looking for contributors, especially for tasks suited to people getting started in this space, please [create a PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) against the `next` branch with the tasks you want to include in the next issue.

## Personal Projects

In this section, we describe updates to personal projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.

### [`metta-systems/vesper`](https://github.com/metta-systems/vesper)

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@berkus](https://github.com/berkus))</span>

Vesper is a capability-based single-address-space nanokernel. This means it is aiming to be small, to provide only isolation primitives; at the same time SAS makes it a lot easier to perform cross-process operations (because all addresses are the same across all processes). It uses capabilities to provide security for such operations, so that unauthorized processes will not be able to intervene in legitimate traffic.

The kernel is in very early stages of development, while I am building up tooling support to make future development fast and painless. This is my second post here and as usual, I will link directly to my blog for more details. [Read the full article here](https://metta.systems/blog/osdev-tooling-2/).

Just a note: since features described in the article are not fully finalized, they are not merged to the main development branch yet and live in [their own branch](https://github.com/metta-systems/vesper/tree/feature/chainboot), which is subject to frequent rebases. Caveat emptor!
