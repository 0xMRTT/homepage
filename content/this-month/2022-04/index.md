## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp), [@josephlr](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/josephlr), [@Freax13](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/Freax13), and [@rybot666](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/rybot666)</span>

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In April, â€¦

### [`xhci`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci)

The `xhci` crate provides types of xHCI structires, such as Registers and TRBs.

In this month, we released a new version 0.8.3 which includes [a bug fix](https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci/pull/132) reported and committed by [@Yuna-Tomi](https://github.com/Yuna-Tomi). The bug was that `EventRingDequeuePointerRegister::event_ring_dequeue_pointer()` did not return the correct address. Thanks for the contribution!.

### [`multiboot2`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2)

The `multiboot2` crate provides abstraction types for the multiboot information structure (MBI) of multiboot2 
bootloaders. The latest release of the `multiboot2`-crate is now `v.0.13.2` (was `v0.13.1`). It contains minor 
improvements, such as that `TagType` implements `Ord`.

## Call for Participation

If you maintain a Rust project related to operating system development and are looking for contributors, especially for tasks suited to people getting started in this space, please [create a PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) against the `next` branch with the tasks you want to include in the next issue.

## Other Projects

In this section, we describe updates to Rust OS projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.

### [`metta-systems/vesper`](https://github.com/metta-systems/vesper)

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@berkus](https://github.com/berkus))</span>

Vesper is a capability-based single-address-space nanokernel. This means it is aiming to be small, to provide only isolation primitives; at the same time SAS makes it a lot easier to perform cross-process operations (because all addresses are the same across all processes). It uses capabilities to provide security for such operations, so that unauthorized processes will not be able to intervene in legitimate traffic.

The kernel is in very early stages of development. This time I will update on the progress of tooling and my next steps. As usual, I will link directly to my blog for more details. [Read the full article here](https://metta.systems/blog/osdev-tooling-3/).

### [`rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials)

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@andre-richter](https://github.com/andre-richter))</span>

The [Operating System development tutorials in Rust on the Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials) project
saw two more tutorial releases:

- [Tutorial 17 - `Kernel Symbols`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials/tree/master/17_kernel_symbols)
- [Tutorial 18 - `Backtracing`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials/tree/master/18_backtrace)

The two tutorials implement the generation of backtraces that show address and symbol information. Here is an example of the of a backtrace generated as part of  the kernel's panic handler:

```console
[    0.002782] Writing to bottom of address space to address 1 GiB...
[    0.004623] Kernel panic!

Panic location:
      File 'kernel/src/_arch/aarch64/exception.rs', line 59, column 5

[...]

Backtrace:
      ----------------------------------------------------------
          Address            Function containing address
      ----------------------------------------------------------
       1. ffffffffc0001294 | core::fmt::write
       2. ffffffffc0005560 | libkernel::panic_wait::_panic_print
       3. ffffffffc00054a0 | rust_begin_unwind
       4. ffffffffc0002950 | core::panicking::panic_fmt
       5. ffffffffc0004898 | current_elx_synchronous
       6. ffffffffc0000a74 | __vector_current_elx_synchronous
       7. ffffffffc000111c | kernel_init
      -----------------------------------------------------------
```
