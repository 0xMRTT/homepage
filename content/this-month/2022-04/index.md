## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp), [@josephlr](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/josephlr), [@Freax13](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/Freax13), and [@rybot666](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/rybot666)</span>

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In April, â€¦

### [`uefi-rs`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@GabrielMajeri](https://github.com/GabrielMajeri) and [@nicholasbishop](https://github.com/nicholasbishop)</span>

The `uefi` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS.

We merged the following changes in April:

#### Features

- [Add support to get the file path of loaded image](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/398)
- [Add `FilePathMediaDevicePath` (and a bunch of supporting code)](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/404)
- [Improve device path API](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/421)

#### Bug fixes

- [Fix undefined behavior in `File::get_boxed_info`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/407)
- [Fix potential undefined behavior in file info](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/408)
- [Fix `test_get_boxed_info` when `-Zmiri-tag-raw-pointers` is enabled](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/415)
- [Fix off-by-one test error](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/422)

#### CI and linting

- [Enable the `clippy::ptr_as_ptr` lint](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/410)

#### Documentation improvements

- [Add changelog entries for recent PRs](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/405)
- [Add documentation on why `UnsafeCell` is used for protocols](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/409)
- [Add documentation links for `BootServices` and `RuntimeServices`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/419)

Thanks to [@supdrewin](https://github.com/supdrewin), [@nicholasbishop](https://github.com/nicholasbishop) and [@raccog](https://github.com/raccog) for their contributions!

### [`multiboot2`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2)

The `multiboot2` crate provides abstraction types for the multiboot information structure (MBI) of multiboot2 
bootloaders. The latest release of the `multiboot2`-crate is now `v.0.13.2` (was `v0.13.1`). It contains minor 
improvements, such as that `TagType` implements `Ord`.


### [`multboot2-header`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2)

The `multiboot2-header` crate provides abstraction types for Multiboot2 headers and a builder struct to construct such 
headers. The latest release of the `multiboot2-header`-crate is now `v0.2.0` (was `v0.1.0`). The changes include a 
bugfix that prevented the usage in `no_std` contexts. Furthermore, overall code quality was improved. The internal CI 
was updated to verify `no_std` builds as well as regular builds. 
Full changelog: <https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2/releases/tag/multiboot2-header-v0.2.0>

### [`volatile`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/volatile)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp)</span>

The `volatile` crate provides a safe wrapper type for implementing volatile read and write operations. This is useful for accessing memory regions that have side-effects, such as memory-mapped hardware registers or framebuffers. In April, we merged the following pull request:

- [Remove the const_generics feature flag](https://github.com/rust-osdev/volatile/pull/25) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.4.5`)</span>

Thanks to [@hawkw](https://github.com/hawkw) for this contribution!

### [`xhci`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci)

The `xhci` crate provides types of xHCI structires, such as Registers and TRBs.

In this month, we released a new version 0.8.3 which includes [a bug fix](https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci/pull/132) reported and committed by [@Yuna-Tomi](https://github.com/Yuna-Tomi). The bug was that `EventRingDequeuePointerRegister::event_ring_dequeue_pointer()` did not return the correct address. Thanks for the contribution!.

If you maintain a Rust project related to operating system development and are looking for contributors, especially for tasks suited to people getting started in this space, please [create a PR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) against the `next` branch with the tasks you want to include in the next issue.

## Other Projects

In this section, we describe updates to Rust OS projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.

### [`rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials)

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@andre-richter](https://github.com/andre-richter))</span>

The [Operating System development tutorials in Rust on the Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials) project
saw two more tutorial releases:

- [Tutorial 17 - `Kernel Symbols`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials/tree/master/17_kernel_symbols)
- [Tutorial 18 - `Backtracing`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials/tree/master/18_backtrace)

The two tutorials implement the generation of backtraces that show address and symbol information. Here is an example of the of a backtrace generated as part of  the kernel's panic handler:

```console
[    0.002782] Writing to bottom of address space to address 1 GiB...
[    0.004623] Kernel panic!

Panic location:
      File 'kernel/src/_arch/aarch64/exception.rs', line 59, column 5

[...]

Backtrace:
      ----------------------------------------------------------
          Address            Function containing address
      ----------------------------------------------------------
       1. ffffffffc0001294 | core::fmt::write
       2. ffffffffc0005560 | libkernel::panic_wait::_panic_print
       3. ffffffffc00054a0 | rust_begin_unwind
       4. ffffffffc0002950 | core::panicking::panic_fmt
       5. ffffffffc0004898 | current_elx_synchronous
       6. ffffffffc0000a74 | __vector_current_elx_synchronous
       7. ffffffffc000111c | kernel_init
      -----------------------------------------------------------
```

### [`metta-systems/vesper`](https://github.com/metta-systems/vesper)

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@berkus](https://github.com/berkus))</span>

Vesper is a capability-based single-address-space nanokernel. This means it is aiming to be small, to provide only isolation primitives; at the same time SAS makes it a lot easier to perform cross-process operations (because all addresses are the same across all processes). It uses capabilities to provide security for such operations, so that unauthorized processes will not be able to intervene in legitimate traffic.

The kernel is in very early stages of development. This time I will update on the progress of tooling and my next steps. As usual, I will link directly to my blog for more details. [Read the full article here](https://metta.systems/blog/osdev-tooling-3/).
