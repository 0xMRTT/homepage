- [Writing a Linux Driver for QEMUâ€™s Debugcon Device](https://phip1611.de/blog/writing-a-linux-driver-for-qemus-debugcon-device/) \
  In this blogpost, [@phip1611](https://github.com/phip1611) shows you can 
  write a Linux driver for the QEMU debugcon device. Although, the driver 
  still uses C, it is a wonderful example to demonstrate a minimal yet useful
  driver. Additionally, it is a good starting point for a rewrite in Rust, once
  the Rust tooling and API bindings in the kernel are more mature. Perhaps, 
  the rewrite in Rust is your next learning project?


## `rust-osdev` Projects

In the November newsletter, I announced the initial release of my 
`paging-calculator` CLI utility. Recently, I released a new version, which now 
covers page table indices for x86, x86 with physical address extension (PAE), 
x86_64, and x86_64 with 5 levels. For example, just type `$ paging-calculator 0xdeadbeef x86`
and `$ paging-calculator 0xdeadbeef x86 --pae`and compare the result. You can 
install it from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/paging-calculator) or with 
the [`pkgs.paging-calculator` attribute](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/1a165401fe904b9cd89bd731e6e8372883652c7d/pkgs/development/tools/paging-calculator/default.nix),
if you are a [Nix](https://nixos.org/) user.
